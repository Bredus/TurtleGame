# TurtleGame

Phaser/HTML5 2-player game about racing turtles.

Players must press a sequence of buttons for the turtle to move it's arms into position, then a final button to shift forward (or UP).

Currently button combos are...

P1 = W -> S -> SPACE
P2 = O -> L -> RIGHT

First to the top wins.

Enjoy!
